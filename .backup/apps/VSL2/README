1. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

   Since the VSL2 itself is implemented in Java, it should be able to run on any
   systems with Java Runtime Environment installed. However, its actual usability
   depends on whether the PSI-BLAST, PHDsec and PSIPRED software can be setup on
   you system.

   The current VSL2 predictor has been tested on several Linux/Unix systems with
   x86 architecture. Two VSL2 variants, VSL2B and VSL2P, were also tested on Windows
   systems.


2. INSTALLATION

   Let's assume that $VSL2DIR is the directory where VSL2 predictor will be installed.

   1) Download and install the Java(TM) Runtime Environment (JRE), version 1.4.2
      or higher. You may want to update the PATH environment variable to include
      the JRE executable directory.

          http://java.sun.com/j2se/desktopjava/jre/index.jsp

   2) Uncompress the downloaded file "VSL2.tar.gz" into directory $VSL2DIR

          % cp VSL2.tar.gz $VSL2DIR
          % cd $VSL2DIR
          % tar zxvf VSL2.tar.gz

      "VSL2.jar" is the executable file, which contains 8 predictor models,
      including VSL2B, VSL2P and VSL2, each using different features combinations.
      Please see the manuscript and the USAGE below for more details.

   NOTE: If you just want to use VSL2B, Step 1)-2) are enough. If you want to
   use VSL2P, Step 5) and 6) can be omitted.


   3) Download the PSI-BLAST package "blast-2.2.12-ia32-linux.tar.gz" from

          ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/release/2.2.12/

      Copy it to directory $VSL2DIR, and uncompress it there

          % cp blast-2.2.12-ia32-linux.tar.gz $VSL2DIR
          % cd $VSL2DIR
          % tar zxvf blast-2.2.12-ia32-linux.tar.gz
          % mv blast-2.2.12-ia32-linux/ blast/
          % cd blast/
          % mv blast/bin/* .


   4) Download the UniRef100 sequence database "uniref100.fasta.gz" from

          ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/uniref/uniref100/

      Copy it to directory $VSL2DIR/blast/, and uncompress it there

          % cp uniref100.fasta.gz $VSL2DIR/blast/
          % cd $VSL2DIR/blast/
          % gzip -d uniref100.fasta.gz

      Use the formatdb program comes with PSI-BLAST to format the UniRef100
      database

          % ./formatdb -i uniref100.fasta -p T -o T -n ur100


   5) Download the PHDsec (v2.1) predictor from

          ftp://cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/pub/rost/phd/install.pl
          ftp://cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/pub/rost/phd/phd_LINUX.tar.gz

      Please follow its instruction to install it into directory $VSL2DIR/phd/


   6) Download the PSIPRED (v2.4) predictor from

          http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/

      Please follow its instruction to install it into directory $VSL2DIR/psipred/,
      make necessary changes to its main file "runpsipred" and prepare the
      uniref100 database as required.


3. USAGE

   The command line to run the VSL2 predictor is,

       % java -jar VSL2.jar <options>

   where possible options are:

       -s:<sequence file>  REQUIRED - Sequence should include the single-letter AA
                           code only; no FASTA header, no 'X', 'Y', 'Z' or other
                           characters
       -p:<PSSM file>      OPTIONAL - PSI-BLAST profile (PSSM)
       -h:<PHDsec file>    OPTIONAL - PHDsec prediction (*.rdbPhd file)
       -i:<PSIPRED file>   OPTIONAL - PSIPRED prediction (*.ss2 file)
       -w:<output window>  OPTIONAL - Must be an odd integer; default value is 1

   The predictor program contains 8 models, each using different features
   combination. Based on the options used, the program determines which model to
   invoke. Following are three examples.

       options used        predictor invoked
       ----------------------------------------
       -s                  VSL2B
       -s, -p              VSL2P
       -s, -p, -h, -i      VSL2

   Other combinations are also possible. Please refer to the manuscript for details.


4. AN EXAMPLE

   Assume file "testseq.fasta" contains the sequence in FASTA format, file
   "testseq.flat" contains the sequence only (i.e. no FASTA header), and both files
   are located in VSL2 installation directory $VSL2DIR.

   1) Generating PSI-BLAST profile.

       % cd $VSL2DIR/blast
       % ./blastpgp -i ../testseq.fasta -d ur100 \
                    -h 0.0001 -e 0.0001 -j 3 -Q ../testseq.pssm > trash.txt

      Where "blastpgp" is the PSI-BLAST program, "trash.txt" will contain all outputs
      and is not used, and "testseq.pssm" is the file receiving the PSI-BLAST profile.


   3) Make PHDsec secondary structure prediction

       % cd $VSL2DIR/phd
       % ./phd.pl ../testseq.fasta sec
       % mv testseq.rdbPhd ../
       % rm testseq.*

      Where file "testseq.rdbPhd" contains the PHDsec prediction, all other output
      files are discarded.


   4) Make PSIPRED secondary structure prediction

       % cd $VSL2DIR/psipred
       % ./runpsipred ../testseq.fasta
       % mv testseq.ss2 ../
       % rm testseq.*

      Where file "testseq.ss2" contains the PSIPRED prediction, all other output
      files are discarded.


   5) Finally, make the prediction

       % cd $VSL2DIR
       % java -jar VSL2.jar -s:testseq.flat -p:testseq.pssm \
              -h:testseq.rdbPhd -i:testseq.ss2 -w:1 > testseq.pred

      Where file "testseq.flat" contains the sequence without FASTA header, and the
      final (numeric) prediction will be written into file "testseq.pred"

5. WEB SERVICE

   The VSL2B and VSL2P predictors are also freely accessible for non-commericial
   use via our web service at

      http://www.ist.temple.edu/disprot/predictorVSL2.php

   However, due to available computational resources, only limited number of
   predictions can be provided per IP address per day.
