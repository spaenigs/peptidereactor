employees to whom it must reasonably be communicated to enable them to
undertake their research and who agree to be bound by the same confidence.
The User shall procure and enforce such agreement from his or her staff for
the benefit of the Copyright holder.

2. The publication of research using the Software must include appropriate citations to the method:

a. If you are using predicted accessible surface area please cite:
-  E. Faraggi et al., ``Improving the prediction accuracy of residue solvent accessibility and real-value backbone torsion angles of proteins by fast guided-learning through a two-layer neural network.'', Proteins 74, 857-871 (2009)

b. If you are using predicted phi/psi angles please cite:
-  E. Faraggi et al., ``Predicting continuous local structure and the effect of 
its substitution for secondary structure in fragment-free protein structure 
prediction'', Structure 17,1515-1527 (2009)

c. If you are using predicted secondary structure please cite:
-  E. Faraggi et al., ``SPINE X: Improving protein secondary structure prediction 
by multi-step learning coupled with prediction of solvent accessible surface area 
and backbone torsion angles'', Journal of Computational Chemistry, In press (2011)

Please use citation b. as a general citation to the software.

3. All forms of the Software will be kept in a reasonably secure place to
prevent unauthorized access.

4. Each copy of the Software or, if not practicable then, any package
associated therewith shall be suitably marked (and such marking maintained) 
with the following copyright notice: "Copyright 2011 E.Faraggi. All Rights
Reserved.".

5. The Software may be modified, but any changes made shall be communicated
to the Author(s) and made freely available.

6. The Software may not be sold as a standalone package, or incorporated into
a commercial software package without the written permission of the Copyright
holder. The Software may be used freely for individual academic research. 
The Software may also be made freely available for training or teaching purposes.

7. The results produced by the Software may not be incorporated into any
data banks or databases which are subject to the payment of access or
license fees without the written permission of the Copyright holder.

8. The Software may be made available to users over a local network or
wide area network (including the Internet), but only if access is granted
free of charge to all authorized users. Incorporation of the Software into
a commercial Web site or other fee paying service is not allowed without
the written permission of the Copyright holder. If SPINE-X results are
returned to the user via such a network service, then a suitable
acknowledgment of the SPINE-X method must be returned near to the
output text.
