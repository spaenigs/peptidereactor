        fragmentation(): breaks an antimicrobial peptide into three fragments, namely the N-, M- and C- Terminal.

        peptide families, Bioinformatics, 31(6), 2015, 849â€“856.
        From table 1 (Khamis et al.), column 1 shows different types of antimicrobial peptides,column 2 shows the dn
        values (N-Terminal = 4*dn) of each type and column 3 shows the dc values: the numbers of amino acids located
        at the end of the peptide.
        In column 2 dn can take 4 different values: 10,12,14,16. If we calculate the average of these values,
        dn = 13 will result.
        In column 3 dc can only take 2 values: 8 and 10. Here, dc = 10 was selected, because 10 is most common for all
        the types. Since the length of antimicrobial peptides differs from 5 to up to 100 amino acids(Khamis et al.),
