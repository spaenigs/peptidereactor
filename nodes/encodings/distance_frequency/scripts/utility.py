        Extracting the edges after applying the Delaunay triangulation on the coordinates of C-alpha (CA) atoms of a

        Each of these vertices/residues represents a point with coordinates (x,y,z) in the graph and is displayed as a
        three letters code of amino acids.

        In this paper, the authors focused on the upper part of the matrix, as well as on the diagonal (A_i, A_i).
        The part of the matrix below the diagonal is ignored, because it is just the reverse display of the upper
        tuples. Therefore their distances remain the same as for the upper one.
