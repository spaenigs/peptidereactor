      the 1625 data; the Schilling data; and the Impens data.

       cleavage sites", Bioinformatics, vol 31 (8), pp. 1204-1210.
       - Discusses the characteristics of the four data sets.
       - It is shown that a linear SVM with standard orthogonal encoding is the best
         predictor when tested across data sets. The AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve)
         values are listed below:

   The 746 and 1625 data sets share many patterns.

       Interactome". Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics, 68, 305–312. 
       Introduced the 1625 data set and used rough set theory on it.
       Note: the 1625 data set used by Kontijevskis et al. is not identical to the 1625 data
       set here, there is one octamer that has a different label (same octamer as for the
       746 data set).

       of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Protease". Journal of Virology, 79, 12477–12486. 
       Introduced the 746 data set and explored linear classifiers plus representations
       based on amino acid properties.
       Note: the 746 data set used by You et al. is not identical to the 746 data
       set here, there is one octamer that has a different label (same octamer as for the
       1625 data set).

4. Other relevant information

   The data sets have appeared in earlier publications (see references in Rögnvaldsson et al. 2015). 
   However, corrections have been made to them here.
   
   Details on references where data has been collected are provided for the 746 and the 1625 data set. 
   The origins of the Schilling data and the Impens data are described in the paper Rögnvaldsson et al., 2015.

5. Number of instances
   - 746 data: 746 
   - 1625 data: 1625 
   - Schilling data: 3272 
   - Impens data: 947 

6. Number of attributes

   There are only two attributes: a 8 letter string (octamer) and a label that tells whether this
   string represents a site in a peptide (or protein) where the HIV-1 protease cleaves it (+1 if yes, -1 if no). 
   The 8 letter string can also be viewed as 8 independent attributes. It is common to map the 8 letters
   to an orthogonal binary representation; a matrix with 160 elements.
   
7. Attributes

   There are 20 allowed letters in the 8 character string (the allowed alphabet): 'ARNDCQEGHILKMFPSTWYV'
   These represent amino acids.
   The cleavage label has only two possible values: -1 and +1.

8. Missing values

   There are no missing values
   
9. Class distributions

   - 746 data: 401 cleaved, 345 non-cleaved
   - 1625 data: 374 cleaved, 1251 non-cleaved
   - Schilling data: 434 cleaved, 2838 non-cleaved
   - Impens data: 149 cleaved, 798 non-cleaved
