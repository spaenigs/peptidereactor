# Signal peptides vs. non-SIG 

##### Description 

    The dataset is taken from [1] and downloaded from http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/data.php. 
    Proteins containing a signal peptide are class 1, class 0 otherwise. The negative data has been sub-sampled to the 
    size of the positive data.
