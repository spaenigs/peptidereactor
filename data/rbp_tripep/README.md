# RNA-binding proteins (RBP) vs. non-RPB 

##### Description 

    The dataset is taken from [1] and originates from human RPB as well as non-RBP. The original negative dataset 
    comprises over 10k sequences, such that only a subset of the negative data is utilized. Hence, the size of the 
    positive and the negative datasets are adapted.
