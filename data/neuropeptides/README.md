# Neuropeptides

##### Description

    From [1]: [This data set contains] NPPs[, that] are pre-pro-polypeptide precursors of NPs. These are secreted 
    proteins. Routine sequence alignment-based methods are insufficient to identify the immensely diverse NPs. 
    [...] The final dataset held 2309 negatives and 1269 NPPs. Note that in the case of NPPs, we expect many 
    unidentified NPP peptides among the proteins in the negative set.
